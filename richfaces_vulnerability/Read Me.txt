 List of Security Vulnarability Issues implemented
        Sql Injection
		Command Injection
		RCE
		Redirect
		XSS attack
		SSRF
		File Path Traversal
		File Upload
         
  a) Sql Injection
     In which attackers enter malicious sql statements are inserted into entry fields for execution.
     http://localhost:8080/sqlinj
     
    Pay load case 1: Enter 1 in userid field here we can see one record related to 1 input.
    Pay load case 2 (Sql injection attack): '1 OR 1=1 , here we can see all records.
    
   b) Command Injection
   Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application
   http://localhost:8080/cmdinj.xhtml
   Pay load case 1:calc
   Pay load case 2:notepad
   
   c) RCE
   Remote code execution (RCE) attack happens when a threat actor illegally accesses and manipulates a computer or server without authorization from its owner.
   http://localhost:8080/rceXtream.xhtml
    
   d) Redirect
   An Open Redirection is when a web application or server uses an unvalidated user-submitted link to redirect the user to a given website or page.
   http://localhost:8080/redirect.xhtml
    
  e) XSS Attack
     Cross-site scripting is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web application.
     We can send javascript code so that it is exceute on browser.
     http://localhost:8080/xssattack.xhtml
     Payload Case 1: Hello
     Payload Case 2(XSS attack): <script>alert("hello")</script>
     
  f) SSRF
  	Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities let an attacker send crafted requests from the back-end server of a vulnerable web application. 
    http://localhost:8080/ssrf.xhtml
    Payload Case 1: http://google.com:80+&@google.com:80#+@127.88.23.245:22/
    
  g) File Path Traversal
  A path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. 
  http://localhost:8080/filePath.xhtml
  Payload Case  1: Give the path of the any of the file in your System Ex: C:\Users\kiran\OneDrive\Desktop\Juice Shop\vunerability level 4.txt
    
  h) File Upload   
  	A local file upload vulnerability is a vulnerability where an application allows a user to upload a malicious file directly which is then executed. 
  	http://localhost:8080/fileUpload.xhtml
  	Payload: Upload any file from your system.
